<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div class="container">
    <div  class="text-container">
        I am Diana Varšíková, a data specialist and software engineering student.<br>
        This blog should serve as my portfolio, but also as a place where I can freely dump my ideas and thoughts.<br>
        I want to share some cool projects, some uncool ones and I also write longer blogposts when I feel like it. <br>

        I've always wanted to create a travel blog of my own, but as I don't think thats happening anytime soon, I sometimes dump travel photos here aswell.<br>

        You can find more about me in the <a href="">About</a> section. <br> <!-- TODO after domain -->
